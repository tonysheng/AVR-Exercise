# Evaluation

General approach for evaluating the effectiveness of growth tactics for AltspaceVR Chrome Extension

## Attribution

Given our goal of sessions started with the extension, we would need to design a way for us to attribute sessions to the chrome extension, and installations with the original source (e.g. social, email). 

This exercise assumes that this is possible.

## Choosing tactics

I wouldn't spend too much time analyzing which tactics to try and which to avoid. Most of them we should do anyways (most of the general tactics). It's the performance marketing that would require more analysis, but I'd want to go light on that for this feature. Instead, I'd want to try all of them on my list and measure success in short intervals. 

## Measuring success

I don't know the volume of sessions today, but we could set a primary goal of number of sessions initiated through the extension per week as a percentage of total sessions per week. 

If a primary activity is sharing a webpage in Altspace, then 10%-20% of sessions might be a good goal. This outcome would prove that people are using the extension.

A secondary goal might be looking at whether total sessions increase. That would suggest that the chrome extension increases total usage.

And finally, we might look at whether there are users that were not very active before that get activated by the ease of the chrome extension. 

## Adjustments

At the very least, we can assess how well each tactic performed against our primary goal of sessions. By looking at the "cost" of that tactic and the impact (# of sessions), we can decide which tactics to reinvest in and which to stop. 

Even better, we could look at each of the tactics across all three of our goals. That way, if one underperforms in one category (e.g. sessions) but outperforms in another (e.g. activating inactive users), we might continue investing in that tactic when we would have stopped otherwise.
