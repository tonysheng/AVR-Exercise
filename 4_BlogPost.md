# Introducing the AltspaceVR Chrome Extension
Experience web content in virtual reality with just two clicks

At AltspaceVR, we're committed to enabling people to experience the web from anywhere, with anyone, in virtual reality. Since we launched in {{date}}, the community has already shared {{number}} of web pages, watched {{number}} of videos on YouTube, and have even streamed live feeds from places like Twitch. Today, we're announcing a feature that makes it even easier to experience and share web content in virtual reality: the [AltspaceVR Chrome Extension](link).

The AltspaceVR Chrome Extension lets you go from browsing in Chrome to viewing in Altspace with just two clicks. Simply navigate to the page you want to experience in Altspace, click on the chrome extension, and follow the link that automatically generates. The link takes you to your public screen.

Watch this video to see it in action:
