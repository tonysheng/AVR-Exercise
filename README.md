# AltspaceVR Marketing Exercise

AltspaceVR has developed a new feature to make it easier to experience web content in VR: the AltspaceVR Chrome Extension. Use chrome to navigate to the page, click the extension, and generate a link that anybody can use to view the page inside of Altspace. 

## Goals

The deliverables listed below are included in this repo

1. Develop messaging for the product [(link)](1_Messaging.md)
2. Plan marketing tactics, timing, and budget for the feature release [(link)](2_PlanAndTactics.md)
3. Articulate a plan to measure success [(link)](3_Evaluation.md)
4. Write a blog post announcing the feature [(link)](4_BlogPost.md)

Bonus. Landing page wireframes [(link)](index.html)

## Original Context

AltspaceVR has a new feature to launch:
The AltspaceVR Chrome browser extension takes any web page and brings it into AltspaceVR. This is another way to access AltspaceVR and content on the web.
When you find content in the Chrome browser that you'd like to enjoy in virtual reality, you simply click the AltspaceVR browser extension. The web page content that is shared onto the public display in an AltspaceVR space. When you click the AltspaceVR browser extension, a screen pops that gives you link to the space. You can use the link to go directly to the AltspaceVR room (in virtual reality). Clicking the link launches the AltspaceVR client and sends you to the space with the web content you just selected. You can also share the link with others and invite them to join you in viewing the web content. For instance you can launch a Netflix movie into virtual reality from the netflix website outside AltspaceVR, or a youtube video, live stream of Twitch, or a blog post from medium or some other news/content site.

Please create a product plan around the AltspaceVR Browser Extension.
1.What would the key messaging that youâ€™d lead with the with for the product / feature?
2. Layout a plan / tactics to market the feature. Assume at a startup every dollar counts, but there is budget to be spent on marketing. Include what you would spend, resources you'd need and length of time, as appropriate. 
3. How would evaluate the tactics.
    a. in selecting which tactics to try
    b. after running them, to determine success
4. Write a 200-400 word blog post to either introduce the feature or campaign that you are proposing #2. I am looking for a sample of your writing, using the feature launch as the prompt. It can be a blog post or campaign email (either to end users or potential end users or influencers, e.g. bloggers).
