# Plan and Tactics

Launch strategy and tactics for the AltspaceVR Chrome Extension

## Strategy

Our metric is number of sessions created using the AltspaceVR Chrome Extension. 

This will come from two sources:

1. Current AltspaceVR users
2. New AltspaceVR users

Because we do not know which of these groups will move the needle most, we will design our tactics to target both groups. Tactics will come in three flavors:

1. General
2. Current user specific
3. New user specific

Let's assume we don't require substantial product modifications to accomplish our marketing goals. If this is the case, we can plan to finish everything within two weeks with nominal spend. 

## Tactics

Numbered lists are in order of potential impact. Instead of assigning dollar costs to each of these tactics, we could assign time costs (scale of 1-10, 10 being most time intensive)

### General tactics

1. Press (4): prepare a press kit/release and pitch the story to tech publications and VR specific journals
2. Blog (1): write a blog post introducing the feature
3. Social (2): share the blog post introducing the feature and the YouTube video
4. YouTube (2): create a YouTube video demonstrating the feature
5. Reddit / Imgur (2): share a post in /r/oculus /r/virtualreality and /r/internetisbeautiful showcasing the feature
6. Webpage (2): update the homepage to announce the feature

### Current user

1. Email (2): send current users an email announcing the feature
2. In-app (4): send a notification in-app announcing the feature. Ideally include instructions inside the app and maybe tag experiences created through the chrome extension as such 

### New user specific

1. Targeted advertising (4): very limited advertising on destinations with a high density of headset owners (e.g. reddit, stackoverflow)
2. In-person marketing (6): if applicable, showcase the feature at tech meetups, conferences, and demo days. Consider a launch party
